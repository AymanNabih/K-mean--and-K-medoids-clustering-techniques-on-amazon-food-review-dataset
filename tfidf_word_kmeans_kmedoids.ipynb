      "I am writing this in response to comments made that this is too sweet.  No I haven't been to Japan...the sushi I've had has been Americanized.  The ginger they normally serve with sushi at lower and mid-budget locations is pink dyed and tastes like remnants of a used alcohol pad.  This brand doesn't have the awful alcohol taste nor artificial flavors.  All the ingredients are organic, and yes, it does taste sweet...but I think that makes it palatable alone as a snack.  It doesn't taste over the top sweet to me...it has 5g. sugar per 2 tbsp.  I add it to my sushi as extra on the side and never notice the sweetness in contrast with the sushi flavors (I eat the ginger with the sushi), but when wanting to eat this alone I'm neither overpowered by the ginger flavor nor an artificial one taking its place.  I would recommend this as the only ginger product I can find that's all natural and organic.\n",

      "We had been buying these jimmies and nonpareils for a while, then the company rolled out their organic non-pareils and the colors on the organic version are worthless, but now that is all our local natural foods store carries.  I was fortunate enough to find these jimmies at Whole Foods while traveling out of state and was happy see some color!  The only other company to sell natural colored sprinkles is India Tree, and they recently cut way back on the colors they offer in non-pareils, and in the past the did not offer natural colored jimmies though those are soon to be available.  I want to note though that the green is a yucky yellow green, not very appealing.  The other colors are fine and are a dark pink, a light pink, white, and yellow.  I gave these only 4 out of 5 stars instead of a 5 star rating because of the poor green, very little variety in color, and a high retail cost of $1.79 per ounce.\n",

      "Yes, there is a distinct difference in taste between Tropic Bee and Savannah Bee Company's Tupelo Honey.  Tropic Bee is a raw unfiltered honey with a distinctive Tupelo taste.  Savannah Bee Company's honey is refined and has only a very faint, almost indistinguishable, Tupelo taste.  If you like the Tupelo taste, which is unlike any other honey, then you definitely want Tropic Bee's honey.  If you want a refined, mellow-tasting honey, then Savannah Bee Company's honey can't be beat.  I love both - but I have to say that I think of Tropic Bee as being real Tupelo Honey, whereas Savannah Bee Company's is just great honey.  Neither one will crystallize, which is a honey-lover's dream come true.\n",

      "Jello (other than the sugarless ones) generally taste great.  It is always relaxing to have a cup of Jello with the smooth texture melting away in your mouth while you're eating it.  The Black Cherry flavor taste quite good with just the right sweetness.  It's not tangy like some of the other flavors such as orange or lime, and it's not somewhat bland like pineapple, it's just rightly sweet without any after-taste.  Each box can make three cups of Jello without losing too much of the taste or too solid of a Jello.  Yum Yum.\n",

I'm almost to the point of clipping back the branches to let it grow even further. I'm so excited as I got the cherry tomato kit...<br /><br />My only cons are that the light it needs to grow under is extremely bright as another poster mentioned here.

The flavor was different, but not really better.  The preparation was easy, but not easier.  The price is higher, so not better.<br /><br />But I think this chicken and broccoli skillet just might be worth the extra money.  Preparation isn't any easier than HH (but really, how hard is it to fix something like this?!  If you've got a problem fixing it, you may just want to step away from the stove and go to a restaurant!).  The price still isn't really cheaper.  But it tastes MUCH better than any Chicken Helper that I've ever had before.<br /><br />The real strength of the Velveeta Skillet dishes is the cheese.  The Helper boxes use powdered cheese and a milk/water combo to make the cheese.  Velveeta takes advantage of their core product to offer a packet of real, honest to goodness Velveeta cheese.  the result is a much richer, cheesier meal that is really light-years ahead of powder.  Compare Velveeta shells and cheese to any powder-cheese and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Preparation is quick, which comes in handy when you're trying to fix something good and quick.  My picky eater didn't like it, though to be honest she barely tried it; in fact, she decided she didn't like it when I told her it was broccoli and cheese.  My son loves broccoli, though, and he cleaned his plate in no time.  Don't tell your kids it's got broccoli in it and they'll be fine -- the broccoli is VERY finely chopped (this is one place that I was disappointed with the Velveeta, to be honest).  You might even experiment with other vegetables, and it's simple to just leave the broccoli out if you don't want it.\n",

My husband loves them enough to eat them cold out of the can, so he'll take them to work for lunch and sometimes have a late night snack (better for him than potato chips or candy bars!).  We also use them as a side dish for pork and sauerkraut meals.  In addition to just microwaving them in a bowl (or eating them out of the can!), here are 2 other great ways to cook them:<br /><br />1)  Put in an ovenproof dish and bake alongside anything else in your oven.  They'll only get better.  We put pork and sauerkraut in one open dish and these in another and leave them both in a 400 degree oven for about 50 minutes with excellent results (try putting sliced sweet onions misted with a little olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper into a third dish for an awesome vegetable side!).<br /><br />2)  If you cook pork chops, hot dogs, sliced ham or kielbasa in a skillet, add these beans to the skillet around the pork and let the flavors mix as both are browned and heated.<br /><br />These are also available in full size cans and are almost indistinguishable from a slightly different version <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002W08VRK\">B&M Grandma's Recipe, with Molasses, 16 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, which tastes just as good and right now is even a little cheaper.  Which brings me to the third great way:<br /><br />3)  To feed a crowd, get the full-sized cans, heat contents in a slow-cooker, add your choice of flavorings (onions, celery, carrots, brown sugar, mustard, ketchup, garlic, diced tomatoes, etc.) and/or meat (chunks of ham, hot dogs, kielbasa, whatever), and bring on the hungry hordes!

I made this tea three ways so here are the three short reviews of each method:<br /><br />Drip Coffee Pot: The package says you can do it, but the tea swells up and backed up my coffee maker something fierce. Taste was full flavored but not too heavy, despite missing a good portion of water that was supposed to drip through and never did. After this incident I decided I would try a different way and just tossed a coffee filter tied with tea in the bottom and tied off at at the top with some cotton thread into the bottom of the pot and ran plain hot water through the maker and it turned out much better. Would achieve the same results from the stove and boiling water, too.<br /><br />French Press: This was the best way of making the tea so far. Since the tea tended to swell up when I added water to it, using the press was the best method because it's pretty difficult to clog a french press.<br /><br />Espresso Machine: I enjoy drinking hot tea for maybe a half hour at a time so there was no real benefit in making a small amount. I still had difficulties with it brewing properly and the whole process just wasn't worth it.\n",

      "I have a very interesting type of cat; he's a Siberian, sort of like a Norwegian Forest cat, and rather rare. We got him as a rescue from the dumpster cat rescue volunteers in our area; my husband saw this cat in a cage and absolutely just had to adopt him. (And we already had a cat. And were living, temporarily in 2 rooms. So you can imagine, it was SOME cat.  One characteristic of the Siberian is that they molt or shed fur in great quantities twice a year. It just COMES off--there is a downy undercoat that stays put and some guard hairs, but the main coat, thick and lustrous, just flies off. You should see the pile outside my office door at home--he sits there. Insane. So the cat gets hairballs. How can he help it? And he prefers to disgorge those hairballs on the BEST decorative rug we own OF COURSE; not on the linoleum in the laundry room, the wood in the entrance, or the regular wall-to-wall carpeting either, no, right smack in the center of the BEST rug.<br /><br />So something had to be done. Anyway, he needs to get rid of the hairballs and merely arfing them up isn't sufficient; cats can get a lot more hair stuck in their gut. So I got a tube of Laxatone on the vet's recommendation. While you can use Vaseline, the problem with vaseline or mineral oil is that the lubricating agent also pulls some nutrients out of the cat, and that is not healthy for them. Laxatone is rather like thick, gooey petroleum jelly, but it is fortified with  linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and peptonized iron to prevent some depletion of nutrients. It's flavored (in this case) with malt. It would seem some cats enjoy the taste of malt. (It's known some cats will lap up beer.) I think it may be that cats eat rodents, and in eating the mouse, they eat what the mouse ate, including perhaps grains that have malted in the gut of the mouse. So perhaps this is, naturally, a flavor cats are inclined to enjoy. In any case, MY cat, LOVES this. He gets the recommended dosage for his larger size, over three days, then gets a maintenance dose once a week or so. The result is a reduction in hairball expulsion and better elimination.<br /><br />If you cat doesn't like malt flavor (there is no pleasing some cats) there is a tuna flavored variety. My previous cat, an equally hairy furball of a Maine Coon, was persnickety about food and was not a snacker. She would eat the malt Laxatone to some extent, then she'd refuse it. This cat eats practically anything, so he's no trouble, and he enjoys his medicine. I enjoy the improved health of my kitty.\n",

Both of which are worse case scenarios.<br /><br />Speaking of worse case scenarios, if you ever run out of food, and it has happened, I mean really Lucky Lady was supposed to win in the fourth my guy swore it up and down, last time I get advice on Horse racing from a guy living in a box but I digress, just take a cup of Beneful put some Ketchup or Catsup (either will work its a personal taste issue at this point) on it and go to town, I also found that you can boil it and fry it, and wow does it taste good, You can also cook it Paula Deen Style but it requires a pound of butter.

      "The Sweetleaf liquid flavored Stevias became a staple in our home after the first bottle. I have hypoglycemia and have been looking for low sugar alternatives for ages that actually taste good and really sweeten without too much fuss. And I have tried just about everything on the market. While there are some other good sugar substitutes out there what sets the liquid Stevia apart to me is that it has no calories, no carbohydrates and no sugar grams, is concentrated so a little goes a long way, is very easy to use and comes from a natural plant. The small bottles are also easy to travel with and as I mentioned it really does sweeten quite well. As far as the taste, depending on how your taste buds are you may want to combine this with other more palatable sweeteners until you get used to the Stevia taste. It can be an acquired taste for some although the flavored Stevias are much less so that just plain Stevia to me. For me, I was quite happy with the taste right off and only use Stevia now for sweetening our beverages and foods. Initially I mixed it with a little honey or coconut sugar and gradually reduced those amounts over time, using the Stevia as additional sweetening and flavoring, mainly because my husband had to get used to the taste. We had used powdered plain Stevia in the past and he didn't really like it, but these liquid Stevias were more palatable to him and now he loves them. It's all we use anymore except when we have guests. Again, matter of taste and what you are used to and what you hope to achieve by using this product.<br /><br />Of all the Stevia flavors, English Toffee is without a doubt my favorite. They really got it right with this one. It gives a distinct toffee flavor to everything I use it in and I am always happy with the result. I often combine it with the Vanilla Creme (another favorite) and they seem to work quite well together. I also use the English Toffee in combination with a few other ingredients to create a coffee substitute drink that no one ever guesses isn't real coffee or doesn't have sugar. For us it's better than any of the coffee substitutes on the market. You may have to experiment and work with these flavors a bit to find what works for you but that is half the fun. The only flavor so far I haven't been too crazy about was the Chocolate Raspberry which I didn't think tasted chocolaty enough. But I'm going to try the plain Chocolate one to see how that one is. Again, it's fun experimenting with all the different flavors and I hope they continue to add more (I would love a maple one). But I am quite happy with the large selection currently available and for me these products have been a blessing in aiding with my hypoglycemia and sweet tooth. I am quite grateful they exist and I will be using them indefinitely.\n",

      "I've have never had a good tasting protein meal replacement shake and this one is no better.  I know taste preference is all subjective.  But if you don't like the sickening sweet flavor of artificial sweetners and that nasty after taste, then you won't like this. Please note I hate the taste of diet soda too, just to give you a reference point.  After forcing myself to drink it once a day for a week, I just couldn't do it anymore. The articial sweetening is too much for me and the thought of having to drink it everyday..well I just can't do it.  I will continue making my own meal replacement shakes with plain whey protein with no artificial sweeters.

      "These granola bars are chewy, crunchy, lightly sweet and packed with good stuff your body needs. I didn't notice the peanut butter flavor as strongly as some other bars I've tried,  but I personally didn't mind. I do not notice an after taste. The bars are a bit small, but for a snack or pick-me-up they're perfect.<br /><br />The nutrition facts show 4 grams of fiber and 4 grams of protein in each bar with 3 grams of fat. Note that 2 of the 3 fat grams are saturated fat and there are no trans fats indicated. 110 calories seems reasonable for a snack bar. There are 17 total carbs indicated, with 7g of sugar. It also shows that there is 2% DRV calcium, 2% iron, 8% riboflavin, and 10% each of thiamin, niacin and vitamin B6. It's low in sodium at 85 mg per bar.<br /><br />All the facts aside, the bar tastes good and I intend to incorporate them as my morning snack. I'm hoping that these will help me in my weight loss goals. The protein and fiber keep me full between meals and I like that it's low calories. I've tried Special K bars in other flavors and am glad to have another flavor to enjoy and add variety to my routine. It kinda helps satisfy that chocolate craving too!\n",

      "Like some other reviewers, I was skeptical, but ordered based on the reviews here. I was even more skeptical when I opened the box and saw that it was \"lite\" tofu (I still don't know what that means, exactly). The stuff even looks bad as you slide it out of the box.<br /><br />However, it is a fantastic tofu product. It is smoother than any tofu I've bought from the grocery store, and I have used it in soups, stir fry, wraps, and plain. This will be the only tofu I buy from now on. If you like silky tofu, you will like this product.<br /><br />In addition to being awesomely tasty, it keeps unrefrigerated in my pantry. From experience, I know it keeps at least five days in the fridge once opened.\n",

      "I'm one of those people who has mysteriously developed a wheat intolerance with age and can no longer eat many \"normal\" foods.  I love barley and buy a lot of it, but pearled barley takes about 45 minutes to cook.  Sometimes I hit the kitchen and I need something fast, something that feels substantial and yet comforting.<br /><br />Dari Barley Couscous, from box to plate, takes less than 10 minutes to prepare. (NOTE: Ignore the package directions for amount of water, salt, and oil.  Use twice as much water as couscous.  Boil water, pour over couscous, let sit for 4 minutes. Fluff with fork, microwave 2 minutes, done.  Add butter or oil, salt, pepper, cheese, whatever, after it's finished.)<br /><br />I've been making a luscious gluten-free, low-glycemic Greek-style salad with it - barley couscous, grilled chicken breast, cherry tomatoes, feta cheese, Kalamata olives, lemon juice/olive oil/oregano dressing. One batch of it makes about five or six great summer meals. Keeps in the fridge for up to a week... if it lasts that long.<br /><br />Please get this back in stock, Amazon! I'm down to my last four boxes!\n",

      "I just started using Flaxseed meal within the last month or so.  I was looking for some nutritious additives, to help put fiber and ingredients that might be good for the heart and the rest of the body, such as lots of omega-3.  Research led me to flax seed, so off I went, to the store and found some.  I started adding it to my cereal for breakfast, my Carnation Instant Breakfast when that's breakfast, my homemade yogurt for my lunch time dessert, my ice cream (OK, an occasional treat that I generally avoid).<br /><br />I found that I like the stuff.  So, when I was getting near to running out of my first pound, instead of buying it at what to me seemed to be inflated prices I decided it was time to check Amazon.com.<br /><br />Wow, am I glad I did.  Four 16 oz bags cost about $5 more than one 16 oz container at the store. I used the subscribe and save option (which I also use for my tea), and it's $13.75 for 64 oz compared to $8 + for 16 at the store.  And this is good stuff.<br /><br />Also, I really like getting Bob's Red Mill because I really respect owner Bob Moore's plans to sell the company to his employees using an employee stock ownership plan.  A really neat thing to do.<br /><br />So, would I recommend this flaxseed meal?  Let's put it this way, I'm giving one of the bags to my Mom, and when I go through the rest, it will be just about time that my subscription sends me more.  And if I'm going to use it, I will definately recommend it.\n",

      "After fooling around years ago with several different teas, my wife settled on this one. I have no memory of what I was drinking before PG Tips, but that must mean that it was forgettable. PG Tips is not. The English seem to know what they're doing in this department. No surprise there. To me it has precisely the right flavor, full and rich. If I get up in the middle of the night, for whatever reason that happens, PG Tips is there to quiet me down and put me back to sleep. (Won't work for those sensitive to caffine, I'm afraid, but I am not.) Now, after a long absence, I've returned to drinking it in the morning in place of coffee. My wife still thinks of it as something to have in the afternoon.  Just the best at any time. Try PG Tips!\n",

And it smells good too.The price is great for the value. I have tried many products that I've spent at least four times as much money on which have not given me as good of a result as this one. You can make a hot oil treatment with it in winter and rub your scalp with it to nourish with moisture against the harsh sun of summer. The only reason it did not merit 5-stars is because I am such a purist when it comes to ingredients. No worries - It would have had to fall off a tree to be pure enough to make 5-stars for me.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9G0\">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil, 3 Fluid Ounce</a>\n",

      "Kashi Heart to Heart Honey Toasted Oat Cereal could be described as Kashi's take on Cheerios.  However oats and shape are about all that they have in common.  The taste of the Kashi cereal is quite different, and one might even say that it is an acquired taste.  I'll admit it is not a flavor that I try to seek out in any other foods, but it is one that I find pleasing enough after having eaten it for years.  I will say that it tastes a lot better than regular Cheerios which taste like Styrofoam.  In addition to taste, Heart to Heart wins over Cheerios on ingredients too.  While Cheerios list \"modified corn starch\" as an ingredient, Kashi using nothing modified.  Kashi also uses evaporated can juice which I prefer over sugar.  Heart to Heart also has a couple of additional ingredients that claim to promote heart health:  grape seed extract and green and white tea extracts.  The USDA has not substantiated these claims yet so take that for what it's worth.  Overall, Kashi's Heart to Heart is the winner for me over Cheerios based on both taste and ingredients.\n",

It's got the best of everything in terms of convenience, taste, and triple bottom line. Here's what I love about it:<br /><br />TASTE:  The rich earthy depth of Arabica coffee infused with exotic overtones of berries and flowers. It's simply divine.<br /><br />CONVENIENCE: Each pouch is individually wrapped to preserve the aromatics, and the drink is steeped like tea, so there is no need for a press or coffee maker.<br /><br />ECO Friendly:  The coffee is 100% organic and fair trade. What's not to love about that?<br /><br />CHARITABLE: A portion of the proceeds of this beverage go to charity to promote youth soccer programs<br /><br />All in all this is a delicious, convenient yummy beverage and a new favorite in our home!<br /><br />Our other favorite is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027CNY7U\">Guayaki Traditional Mate Tea Bags, 75-count</a>\n",

      "Our 10 y.o., 10 lb. Poodle mix (rescued from The Humane Society...she got a home and we left another cage open to rescue another dog or cat) has been eating the major manufacturer premium brand \"E\" food for small dogs.  Then, when she turned 10, I started thinking of her health and how long she would be with us - she's a little girl with a \"really  huge\" personality and presence...  We want her around as long as possible...<br /><br />So I started reading up on dog food's and nutrition - after awhile I settled on giving Blue a try.  We carefully mixed a little with her old food for a month until she was eating only Blue.  My friend mentioned she was perkier - she's always way over-active but she said \"really looking good, bright eyes, etc.\"<br /><br />Another benefit is she evacuates easier, we realize her food is moving through her while it still has fluids making it easier for her to take care of her business, instead of her having to push so hard, and she goes a little more often also.<br /><br />We find her general health to be AOK, and the nutrients and ingredients are better...  Just 'read the ingredient list' on your dog's food bag!  So now she gets a \"super\" premium dog food.  Luckily, she's small and isn't a food hog or we'd have to get a part-time job to keep her in deluxe food.  But, don't mistake the comment, we would do whatever needed to keep our pup in good health and here with us for many more years.  She's a part of our family, in fact, she's got a \"second Mom & Dad\" down the block and we can say she's the only dog on the block who \"owns\" two homes!  Lucky little dog...  Lucky humans...\n",

      "My dog is on a totally raw diet, which clearly presents challenges during travel.<br /><br />During a recent trip to Florida I took along a few bags of Stella and Chewy's steaks in lamb, beef and duck flavors.<br /><br />While you can feed the food dry, I opted to add a little water and rehydrate them.  While my dog had never eaten S&C food, he immediately took a liking to it, finished everything on his plate, and asked for more.<br /><br />IMO the real measure of how good a food is lies in what comes *out* of the dog, and this food totally agreed with his digestive system.  His stools were just as perfect eating S&C steaks as they were eating raw food.<br /><br />I will definitely keep Stella and Chewy's steaks on hand for those times when feeding raw food is impractical or impossible.<br /><br />If you're looking for an easy, practical and healthy solution for traveling/camping with your dog, Stella and Chewy's is it!\n",

      "Heat 8-10 oz 2% or whole milk, not quite to boiling, in your microwave. Add ~1-1/4 rounded teaspoons of Ghirardelli Mocha Hot Choc powder + ~1-1/8 rounded teaspoons of Ghirardelli Hazelnut Hot choc powder, stirring to fully mix. Now add ~3/4 oz Christian Brothers VS Brandy. (Optionally) garnish with whipped cream or a small accent of vanilla ice cream and serve.<br />Notes: Not to be a brand whore, but Christian Bros (VS, not the more expensive VSOP) is the only brandy I've found to really have the right profile for this recipe. Exact proportions for all 4 ingredients should ultimately be to your own taste. Non-fat and 1% milk are NOT recommended. The brandy should contribute its flavor but not be so strong as to have an obvious alcoholic note. I've for many years used a 1.0 Mocha + 1.5 Hazelnut ratio, but lately the Mocha product hasn't seemed as intense, so I've adjusted. You'll know it's right when the mocha + hazelnut + brandy flavors are in such balance that none is too dominant -- the result will be a new experience \"greater than the sum of its parts.\"\n",

My first glass of this milk acted like a probiotic. Milk I had as a child which I had gotten away from.  My food settled down where it supposed to go after my first glass of this milk.  I was so happy with this powdered milk that I would recommend it to anyone. Throw out the lactose milk and get good quality milk. True, it is expensive, but it is worth the cost.  The feeling of not being bloated, not drinking milk with additives and preservatives, knowing that it is nutritious, that the milk comes from the best dairy country, thrills me greatly.

Just sweet enough, but very fruity, almost like the tea with flavored syrup you get in restaurants. I'm addicted to these now and can't go back to the hum-drum Crystal Lite flavors. The other flavors are great too - my favorite being Blackberry Pomegranate. I'm so sick of the same ol' same ol' Lemonade, Raspberry Lemonade, Orangade, Strawberry Kiwi, etc. These flavors sound a bit odd at first, but the taste is crazy good.<br /><br />I should mention that the crystals are a little harder to break up in cold water than most single drink mixes.

I was really hoping this matcha would be more like the fresh butterscotch syrup you put on ice cream sundaes, and I was right! The flavor is so smooth and perfectly butterscotch-y.

Easy to make and the taste is very good.

He has had allergies all of his life, but recently they had gotten worse, with him having open sores on his underbelly, and bloodshot eyes, despite bi-weekly baths and benadryl.

Six weeks later, his eyes are clear, he has stopped scratching, and his skin is much less red.<br /><br />However, this dog food did something else, something that is amazing.  Corgis are very prone to arthritis and hip problems.

Aside from an occasional limp on one paw damaged by rolling his entire body weight over one shoulder from three feet in the air in a bad frisbee catch, his gait is entirely normal.

But this product is not SB's best effort.  First, the packaging isn't well designed.  Tearing the top off at the \"tear here\" line always leaves part of the top intact, making getting the coffee out a chore, and trying to tear off the rest of the sticky top is not worth the effort.  Next, the flavor.  I know Italian is supposed to be bold and bitter, but this stuff takes bitter to a whole new level.  Not good.  Then there's the expiration.  I didn't plan to use this very often, but I'd better, because it expires in less than a month.  What?  Finally, the cost.

That is fine with me- I always have lots of veggies in my rice dishes, so if some of the fiber is taken out with partial milling, I can live with it. The flavor really is better than white, and the texture is not nearly as \"tough\" as brown.\n",

      "PROS<br /><br />1) It has a great taste.<br />2) It does not have a bitter/burnt taste right after drinking.<br />3) It tastes better than Nescafe Clasico (Classic).<br />4) It lives up to its name: \"Taster's Choice.\"<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />1) It costs more than Nescafe Clasico.<br />2) The design on the container is ugly. Nescafe Clasico has a better design. They should invest on a better design so as to attract more customers. I bet many people have not bought this coffee because of the design.\n",

      "This is caramel corn is absolutely delicious.  You can taste the quality such as real butter, good caramelization on each popcorn, and overall great craftsmanship.  Fortunately, I live in Seattle so I can buy this locally without the unfortunate shipping price.  I give this out to our visiting out-of-town friends who always beg us to send more because it is truly addictive.  If you live in Seattle or come for a visit, definitely give it a try since you will find them in most local grcoery stores and sometimes even on sale  :)\n",

      "Not bad tasting at all.  Sometimes I want to drink something that isn't water and that is when Crystal Light comes in.  Its Kool-aid for adults right?  What's more adult than a mocktale that you might be able to add tequila to and make it a real treat.  Forget the latter and stick with just assuming it's another flavor of drink. Put it right up there with grape on the tastey chart.<br /><br />I think it is rather tasty. It was refreshing and bright.<br /><br />Adding Jose tequila to it made it taste bad.  I didn't like it at all.<br /><br />Good mocktale.<br />Bad cocktale.\n",

      "So many things to love about this product...<br />1. It tastes great, we can't tell by the taste that it's not cane sugar.<br />2. It's supposed to be good for you in small amounts, especially your teeth and gums.<br />3. It's from Birch Trees, NOT corn like most other Xylitol is.<br />4. It's made in the USA. Fabulous!<br /><br />The only drawback is the price is so high. I won't be able to use this in large amounts due to the price, and also because it could cause stomach upset if too much at a time is consumed. Every day I allow one teaspoonful of this Xylitol to melt in my mouth for it's beneficial effects. I don't have any particular reason for this dosage. It just seems about right for me. So far I've had no negative effects.\n",

      "This mustard is fantastic (and I don't even really like mustard!)  The blue cheese is just subtle enough to provide a flavor without being overpowering.  My better half doesn't like blue cheese, but he loves this mustard.  The jar itself is aesthetic, and I would recommend this product to anyone who even has inkling that they might be interested.\n",

      "These sounded so good.  I wanted to like them, but they seem more like a cheap candy than anything healthy.  When you get to the honey center you can barely taste it.  The outer part looks similar to a Werthers Original hard candy, but tastes nothing like it.  I've had imitation Werthers that had much more flavor than these.  I'm not impressed by adding a few vitamins and trying to pass it off as a healthy treat.  There are 9 to a pack at 20 calories each.  No fat, protein, or cholesterol.  So, they aren't bad for you.  I just don't see much benefit, IMO.\n",

Having a candy store in your closet.<br /><br />Not much else to say except if you like bottle caps and buy them even on a semi regular basis then this is a great deal.\n",
