      "After receiving a K-cup coffee maker for Christmas, I have tried many coffees. This is absolutely my favorite so far. Its rich and flavorful, not bitter. I used to roast and grind my own beans, this is so much more convenient and very tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchase a number of brands of K-Cups and Timothy's is one of them. It has taken quite a while to find the various brands/flavors that receive my most favorable reviews and Timothy's Italian Blend is one that I highly recommend. I prefer a bold cup of coffee, but not a cup that will leave your eyes the size of silver dollars. This particular coffee provides very substantial flavor with a slightly nutty finish and is not bitter at all. The Italian Blend is one of my particular favorites and I've re-ordered it several times. Hence, if you're looking for a NOT TOO BOLD flavor, along with a noticably nutty finish, this coffee is for you!!\n",

      "Let me just say that I am so impressed with the Senseo machine.  I can never get coffee tasting just right, so the pod system really attracted me.  I kept debating between the Senseo and the HomeCafe.  It was a demo of the senseo that made me decide to go with it.  The Senseo brews a nice small cup of coffee that is nice and frothy.  It gives you the sensation of a cappuccino or latte after adding a little milk.  I adore the mild roast and the decaf roast.  I finally can have a great tasting cup of coffee whenever I want it!  It's perfect if you're a college student!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This coffee has a nice, smooth flavor.  Even though it is an extra bold, but then again I like stronger coffees.  This is strong, smooth and not bitter.  I know some coffees that are strong can have a bitter flavor, but not the starbucks Sumatra.  The smell of course is wonderful!  I like the whole bean because grinding them at home, I can increase it's flavor and it keeps the flavor fresh.\n",

      "I prefer it dry as a snack although some pieces are hard and large enough to make one think it could break a tooth. A caution is one cup has 200 calories and trust me it would be easy to eat 2-3 times that amount while mindlessly watching a movie. This specific cereal does has quite a bit of sugar which could be reduced without any negative flavor effects. It also has 8 grams of fiber if you are trying to get 20-30 grams per day. This is my second favorite Kashi cereal with Kashi U Cereal, Black Currants & Walnuts being number one. I think Kashi in general makes wonderful products (okay some of their \"bars\" aren't so hot)and though most aren't organic, I think their brand is safer and healthier than most other non-organic brands.\n",

      "Grape-Nuts are one of the oldest ready-to-eat packaged cereals still on the market today. Introduced in 1898, Grape-Nuts followed the first breakfast cereal (Granula) by a few decades, but stuck around much longer. They pre-date Kellogg's Corn Flakes by nearly a decade. Like Kellogg's early cereals, Grape-Nuts were initially marketed as a natural health food. Made from wheat and barley, without added sugar, they still pack a great deal of nutrition into a compact space. Each half-cup serving of Grape-Nuts contains 33 grams of whole grain, 48 grams of carbohydrates, 6 grams of protein and 7 grams of dietary fiber. They're low fat (1 gram per serving) and contain no trans fats.<br /><br />Grape-Nuts have a sweet, nutty wheat flavor and are very crunchy; too crunchy for some cereal eaters. The nuggets are small and soften slightly in milk. Those who prefer softer cereal can make hot grape nuts by adding a third-cup milk and microwaving the mix for 30-60 seconds. More time produces a softer result. Those who like something sweeter than the natural 4 grams of sugar per serving can add raisins, chopped fruit, a teaspoon or two of sugar, or sweetened soy milk. Their compactness also makes them a good pick for travel rations or backpacking, and a full serving is quite a bit smaller than for a typical flaked cereal.<br /><br />Grape-Nuts are great for breakfast, an afternoon snack or a treat before bed, and you can sprinkle them on yogurt to add some crunch! Recipes for Grape-Nuts bread, bars, pudding, muffins, tabbouleh salad and many other items can be found on Post's Grape-Nuts website and elsewhere on the Internet. [?2010 hyperbolium dot com]\n",

      "Kellogg's Corn Pops breakfast cereal in these 1.5 ounce cups boasts a delicious and flavorful taste. It contains no cholesterol, no fat and it is low in calories. The delicious taste and the nutritional value that it does have make this better for you or your kids than skipping breakfast. It is low in carbohydrates, too. It stays crunchy in milk; and I enjoy the strong corn taste. Milk enhances the excellent flavor of the cereal. It is also certified kosher if that's important to you.<br /><br />Unfortunately, some disappointments exist. The cereal is only average in terms of vitamin content, reaching at the very best 30% of your recommended daily intake of niacin, vitamins B6 and B12, riboflavin, thiamin and folic acid. It delivers somewhat less than average value in the vitamin department. Corn Pops in these 1.5 ounce cups cannot be considered a substitute for a morning vitamin if you need one. Therefore I will take off one star to make this a four star review.<br /><br />Kellogg's Corn Pops cereal does contain partially hydrogenated vegetable oil and this can convert in your body to trans fat. Be careful!<br /><br />One more caveat: this product contains traces of soybeans and it is made with wheat. Ask your doctor before eating this cereal if you are unsure if your body can tolerate these ingredients. In addition, consult your doctor about your diet from time to time.<br /><br />Overall, these 1.5 ounce cups of Kellogg's Corn Pops truly are very useful for people on the go or kids who want an after school snack that's not too bad for them. The cereal does have some basic nutritional value. Nevertheless, Kellogg's Corn Pops cereal cannot be a substitute for a daily vitamin.\n",

      "The Healthy Choice Chicken & Dumplings Soup was very tasty and more hearty than I expected.  There is more broth in this product than in Healthy Choice's beef soup and chicken and rice, but still satisfying.<br />**Do be careful if you are on a low-sodium diet, as it is difficult to dillute this product to reduce the sodium any further.  But it still has far less sodium than in regular soups.<br /><br />TIP: Healthy Choice Soups are good for enhancing larger pots of soup when added to your own fresh ingredients.

Planters didn't use a pea shooter to put the best of their product together.  Some products will stress a certain item only to have very little in there.  Not so here.

      "5-Hour Energy Drink actually does work.  If I am exhausted, it does not make me feel great, but it will get me through.  It creates enhanced alertness, also seems to have a positive effect on eyesight and helps with tired eyes.  It does take most of the \"awfulness\" out of being overly tired, and can make it possible to do the things I still need to do if the day is not over, even if I wish it were.  The first time you take it, everything may seem \"brighter\" for a few moments (light sources may seem to \"pop\" slightly more than normal).  This passes, and it feels like you were able to take a 90-minute power nap.  For me, it lasts a bit less than the full 5 hours, but it is a very welcome boost.  There really is no crash for me when it wears off, as advertised, and it does not make me feel \"wired\", just more alert.  Not bad for something that comes in a little bottle for a couple bucks.  As with all good things, be sensible, and if you choose to try it, use in moderation.  I do not and would not use this every day, but it is nice to know it is there when needed from time to time.\n",

      "I really do not consider myself to be very knowledgeable with tea, accessories, brew times, and such. I often go to the nearest import store and just pick the first box that pops out. Ive tried P.G. Tips, Ty?phoo, Williamson's Lifeboat, Lyons, Adagio as well as Republic of Tea and Teavana. Each time I finished a box or a foil bag, I am always left wanting more of something a little different. I had about 1/2 a box of P.G Tips and a near full box of Lifeboat when this English No. 1 tea was delivered. After making a quick sample cup, I realized this is a tea Ive been looking for. The first pitcher disappeared within three hours.<br /><br />English No. 1 has a very smooth taste and feel. The color is a nice dark brown- a brown that best matches a mental picture of a perfect cup of tea. Without sugar, I dont find it bitter, tart, or very peppery. I make a 64oz pitcher of tea, lightly sweeten it with less that a 1/4 of a cup of German Rock Cane Sugar, and sit back and drink it all at dinner; rarely do I even have enough to consider to placing the pitcher in the refrigerator. For my 64oz pitcher, I brew 6 tea bags (although 5 do nicely) for an amount of time ranging between 5 to 10 minutes. A tea connoisseur might have their heart skip a beat at that statement, but I do like my tea strong and dark. I do not like looking at a cup of brown tinted water (in SE Houston, there is a small joke about cloudy water looking like the water in Clear Lake or Galveston Bay). Even so, the final product is not overwhelming. From a longer brewing time, the tea becomes opaque. After pouring a tall glass, I will then add more water into the pitcher to further dilute it. The bergamont flavor is still detectable and still contributes to the overall taste.<br />Even if this tea is brewed appropriately and as a single serving, this tea is still great. My next shipment is not scheduled to arrive until the 16th but I am already working on my last tin.<br /><br />The tin is small but sturdy. It does not feel cheap nor is it cumbersome to open. The lid forms a tight seal and nicely preserves the tea. The image on the tin, if I remember correctly, commemorates the opening of the Tower Bridge. Its a nice tin, to be sure, and a nice memento to keep but after your first shipment youll have three too many. I would have liked to have seen different paintings on the tins but... who cares?

Something so minuscule should not detract from the quality of something so great.<br /><br />Amazon, as it is described in the product headline, says they will ship four tins in one shipment. If there are similarities, you may just as well make a pitcher of tea each day and run out way before the next subscription shipment is delivered.\n",

      "I haven't tried this tea yet, but the description is a little misleading.  When it is said that this cake can make 75 servings, what they really mean is that you can have 75 \"Gong-fu\" sessions with this tea.  This type of Chinese tea is typically put into very small Yixing teapots (approx 5-7gr of tea into a 110-120 ml teapot), rinsed once or twice (probably once for this expensive tea), and then poured into teacups.  A very high-quality Puerh (aged \"raw\", not aged \"cooked\") can make anywhere from 5-10 teapots-full of the tea before running out of leaf.  Sometimes even more.  Usually the desired effect of these very-old teas is not exactly how they taste, because often-times they won't taste like much more than flavored water, but instead the \"Cha-Chi\", which is a type of energy or feeling that your body feels when/after drinking these teas.  The feelings can be anything from quite stimulating, to very soothing (almost narcotic).  There are many fakes in the market-place, due to extremely rare occurences of any REALLY good, old raw Puerh tea being found outside of Asia.  Any that are found will definitely command very high prices because this type of tea is usually hoarded in China, Taiwan, and anywhere else that anyone can find any of it available for purchase.  Also, when someone states \"60's Puerh tea\", that is a whole decade of variance to deal with.  Before taking the plunge with Puerh tea, start doing your research.  Puerh tea has really been taking hold of the West in recent years, and now the East is capitalizing on our desires for really good Puerh teas.  There are some very good reliable sources out there, but it usually incurs a monetary learning-curve before you get the hang of who you can trust, and what Puerh teas may be right for you.  BUYER BEWARE!  I hope I am not overstepping any bounds by saying this, but a good place to start learning about Puerh tea would be \"Puerh Tea- A Westerner's Quest\" website.  Good luck, and Good health!\n",

I have to say that I really didn't notice that they were low sodium as far as affecting the overall sardine taste.  Love the ones without oil as I don't really like that greasy fish taste you get with some sardines.

The oil is hard when refridgerated (cold brownies), but liquifies above 78 degrees F., so it literally melts in your mouth.  It also gives brownies a great extra sweetness.  You can use it in place of butter or lard in most baking recipes.  I also use it in the pancake pan and egg pan and to grease pans before baking.  This two-bottle version is actually less expensive per oz. than the large bottle version using the subsribe and save option.\n",

Since olive oil is heart healthy and this one is not overly expensive, I probably use it more than anything else in my kitchen.<br />It is hard to find, so I'm delighted that Amazon makes it available.\n",

Contrary to what's listed above, it does *not* contain hydrogenated *anything.*<br /><br />However, we're a bit concerned with the Palm Oil and Palm Kernel oils, and were told by BNRG that this was the healthiest alternative for the chocolately coating on the outside and the inside filling that would remain solid at room temps.<br /><br />My suggestion to them would be to make an alternative variety that has NO chocolatey coating (much like Bisco's sugar wafers), thus limiting the amount of oils that they'd need to use in these otherwise stellar protein bars.\n",

      "I moved to the US from the UK over 30 years ago and Lipton's tea was a huge let down.  I've managed to find reasonable black tea at asian food stores or in the specialty aisle at big supermarkets but nothing compares with Yorkshire Gold.  I grew up very close to Harrogate so it's always a nostalgic moment when I reach into the box to grab a bag and see images of the Yorkshire countryside.\n",

      "I just made my first cup, and the tea lives up to its great reputation. I'd been wanting to try this brand since I found out that my great- great-grandfather was a Dane from Yorkshire, who immigrated to the USA. I'm sitting here in the US Heartland having my first cuppa Yorkshire Gold. I will buy this again, absolutely. I made it in a pre-warmed mug with 1/2 scoop of loose leaves and poured boiling water over it. Steeped for 2 minutes, added a splash of milk and a 1/2 spoon of sugar. This is a rich, robust, slightly aromatic tea: YUM!\n",

      "I've been eating these noodles since childhood.  My parents would buy these noodles by the boxes from the Asian grocery store.  Maybe, I'm partial, but these noodles are consistently good.  Simply add water and any vegetables, and you'll have a delicious meal.  These style of noodles are sold at restaurants for probably at least $5, so buying this and eating it at home is a an effective use of money.  I have tried the other flavors but I recommend shrimp as the best Udon flavor.\n",

I love that these treats aren't full of things I cannot pronounce. They also don't have a bunch of things in it that make no sense to feed a dog (like sugar). These treats are also made in the USA, which is important to me. All in all, these are great treats. The dogs love them, and I can give them treats without feeling guilty, or worrying that they will get sick. Try them yourself, your dogs will love you for it.\n",

      "I have been drinking Good Earth Decaf Green Tea for many years and it is my favorite tea.  This tea is not purely green tea leaves - it also contains lemongrass and other flavors.  It is flavorful but mild.  Ingredients: Decaffeinated Green Tea, Lemongrass, Natural Flavors (Contains Soy Lecithin), Rose Petals and Peppermint.<br /><br />Be aware that the Good Earth Decaf Green Tea does not have the more delicate flavor as real Japanese green tea (and not a roasted flavor like Genmai), but it is great as an everyday tea.  If you are expecting green tea like in Japanese restaurants, this is not it - if you want that, get high quality loose tea leaves and brew it with the correct temperature water in a teapot.  (Although maybe the Good Earth green tea would taste more similar to Japanese green tea if brewed like Japanese green tea should be - read on...)<br /><br />I often leave my tea bag steeping for a long time (I know, not recommended for green tea, but it likely does extract more of the beneficial antioxidants), up to 30 min, and this tea does not get bitter.  It also does not get bitter if the tea sits around before drinking.  One Good Earth tea bag works fine for my large 16 oz mug.  I have found that other brands of tea can be weak and not flavorful if using only one bag for 16 oz water.<br /><br />I also like that this tea is decaf since even the smaller amount of caffeine in green tea affects me.  Decaf green teas are somewhat hard to find.  This company uses a CO2 process for decaffeination, preferable to a solvent extraction process.<br /><br />Note that this product is available in 18-count and 25-count boxes.  My local grocery store has stopped carrying the 25-count and only stocks the 18-count.  I like that Amazon carries the 25-count boxes since I go through a lot of this tea!  It is also a better deal at Amazon.<br /><br />I have tried many other brands of green tea (decaf and regular) over the years and keep coming back to Good Earth brand.  Highly recommended.\n",

      "In my opinion, this is the most \"complete\" hot sauce that I've found so far.  Many sauces have a great flavor but don't pack enough punch in the heat department..  Other sauces are VERY hot (which I like) but don't taste particularly good in my opinion.<br /><br />This particular product satisfies both departments:  It won't kill you with heat, but is certainly hot enough to satisfy most anyone, and is likely too hot for lightweights (those not used to spicy food).  Don't drown your food in this sauce, because it WILL light you up if you overdo it, and it is more than capable of coming back to haunt you several hours later, hehe.  Anybody experienced with HOT food knows what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Oh, and this is a great tasting sauce.  I love using it on homemade tacos, enchiladas, etc. to add an extra dose of rich flavor.  Yum!  Out of any sauce that I would classify as more than just \"moderately hot\", Pure Habanero has easily the best flavor of anything I've tried (so far).<br /><br />I highly recommend this sauce if you want a great tasting sauce that is sure to get your attention, yet still bearable.  Only the most hardcore hot sauce junkies would be likely to find this sauce too wimpy.  5 stars!\n",

This is an absolutely scorching puree of blazing peppers. The hottest sauce I've found without<br />capsaicin extract added.

I had a bit of trepidation over trying this coffee, since I had never purchased pre-ground coffee before, but after the first cup, my reservations vanished.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, we were dazzled by the rich scents that were released when we opened the bag for the first time. It was surprising then, that the resulting coffee didn't have that much aroma. Don't get me wrong - the coffee tasted great, but I wanted a richer experience.<br /><br />Overall, we concurred that it's better than most store brands like Costco's Kirkland Signature or lower-priced brands like San Francisco Bay, but Starbucks own beans or some of the beans available from Peets produced better coffee.

Without enough iron, your body can't produce enough hemoglobin, a substance in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen. As a result, iron deficiency anemia can leave you tired and short of breath.  The solution: boost your iron intake.<br /><br />One tablespoon of this tasty delight has 70% RDA of iron and it tastes pretty good too.

Fantastic stuff.<br /><br />I recommend Mustapha's Moroccan Harissa - it was terrific.\n",

      "I received my case of these delicious, crunchy gems a couple of days ago. I am going to have more delivered in just a few weeks because I am enjoying them so much for breakfast and snacks. They are slightly nutty, fresh, and much better than other brands I have tried. They arrived in perfect condition. The price for this as a Subscribe and Save item is about $2 lower for each package than the price in my local grocery store, giving me a savings of about $24 per case. I love having a big supply around, as I am eating gluten-free. This is truly the best-tasting rice cake on the market. It is hard to understand why one reviewer didn't like the taste. I\"m guessing that he or she doesn't like rice cakes. However, if you already know that you like rice cakes, you'll love these and save yourself a lot of money by ordering from Amazon.\n",

And last but not least, since they were brought<br />for the Master Cleanse they were not put in the refigerator. They<br />lasted several weeks without going bad. I highly recomended this<br />product and will reorder.\n",

      "I remember back when the only flavor you could get your hands on were the cheddar twists and they were absolutely delicious and completely addictive.<br /><br />When they came out with these crisps I thought it was a stroke of genius.  They are the perfect size for snacks at a casual gathering with friends, pairing beautifully with fresh fruit and wine, the tang of the cheese and the kick of heat at the back of your throat the perfect counterpoint to the sweetness of grapes, apples and pears.<br /><br />When having a more elegant gathering I'll put out black olive tapenade or a quick relish made with finely diced English cucumber, green onion, a touch of sundried tomatoes and marinated artichoke hearts.  They disappear off the trays and because of their sturdiness they hold up pretty well to having a dollup of something on top.<br /><br />These also offer a delicious alternative to croutons when served with a salad because of the complex flavors that you can get.<br /><br />The one thing that I will warn folks about is that these crackers are crunchier than your traditional crackers, not as dense as biscotti but it gives you about the same crunch when you chew, but the beauty of these crackers is that the more you chew the more flavorful they become, and they really pair beautifully with adult beverages of every sort.<br /><br />Give these a try as an alternative to chips and you'll find they can be more addictive than chips and they're healthier for you!\n",

      "This is a very nice cereal.  It is very crunchy and is sweetened with honey.  I would have preferred that the cereal not be quite as sweet as it was so I gave it four stars rather than five.  This may not be an issue for other consumers.  It is not as sweet as a product like Cap'n Crunch or Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  I do not care for milk in my cereal but another family member tried it with milk; the cereal held up and did not become soggy. I would buy this cereal again.\n",
