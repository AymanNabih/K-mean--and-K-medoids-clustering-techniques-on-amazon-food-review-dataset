My wife has bought more of them since we finished off the sample box in less than a week. If you don't like Mini-wheats, I recommend that you try these if you like Cinnamon Rolls. You will not believe how much they taste like the real thing. Some who have tried them said they have a maple taste, which is true. Real Cinnamon Rolls usually have a maple frosting coating on them so these mini-wheats are an accurate representation of what a Cinnamon Roll tastes like.\n",

Nope, it's none of those things.  It's \"just right.\" It holds itself together perfectly, isn't messy or crumbly when you bite into it, and its easy to bite off and chew without cracking a tooth. Nor would it melt in the car if left inside a warm car for awhile.  (Not sure about the choco-peanut butter one, tho, since I haven't tried it yet).<br /><br />It's very small, however, but because its chia, it still has that long satiety and satisfaction level--for hours, actually, much like drinking the gel does.<br /><br />This seems to be made from white chia seeds, so it doesn't leave any visible dark residue in the teeth in case you can't brush after eating.<br /><br />I would give it five stars, but because the price seems high for 15 tiny bars, it's not that great a value in my opinion.\n",

The Gentlease did reduce the gas but it caused her to have constipation.  So, after about three weeks I decided to switch her back to the formula she was on before thinking maybe we could control her gas with gas drops.  Boy, was that a BIG mistake!!  Our daughter went from being mostly mild mannered to a screaming hellion in less than 8 hours after switching the formula, she also went from sleeping great to waking up EVERY HOUR in pain from the gas.  I switched her back to the Gentlease and in about 4 hours we had our a sweet baby back.<br /><br />Pros<br />-It does what it claims to do, reduces gas and fussiness.<br /><br />Cons<br />-My daughter still has trouble with constipation but I will take the constipation over a screaming, non sleeping infant; there are things I can do to remedy her constipation.<br /><br />In short, I would recommend a parent try out this formula with their infant if they are having gas issues.  Will this formula work for everyone?  No, every infant is different and you will just have to try out some formulas to see which one works best for your baby.\n",

In the past, I purchased the larger size and cut them with heavy duty scissors, but these petite chews are fine as is.  Unlike rawhide chews, these are consumed rather quickly and don't require the strongest of teeth, so they are much better for older dogs who still like to chew.

You only need to chew it for about 5 minutes to absorb the xylitol, so it works for me.<br /><br />I made the switch over from Spry gum for one main reason: The XyloBurst did not list titanium dioxide in its ingredient list.  I was concerned about this ingredient after reading that it was potentially carcinogenic.  And Spry uses it for nothing more than a coloring agent.  Why bother with the risk?  Although, to be fair to Spry, I did not notice this ingredient in some of its other flavors/varieties.

Easy to make your own, of course, but the packaging makes it so incredibly portable and eliminates the problem of storing leftovers if you're away from a fridge.  I confess the ease of use occasionally makes me pop one at home, too.  I appreciate the lack of added sugar, though of course the fruit juice itself is naturally sweet -- but the selzer helps cut it, as does the ice which I strongly recommend you pour it over.  Hard to find in our local grocery store (sells out!!), so it would be wonderful to be able to order in bulk at a reasonable price through Amazon!!\n",

I take out what I need for espresso and regular coffee.<br /><br />The taste is VERY smooth - I regularly drink Blue Mountain, and I compare this in smoothness to that.  The best part is the high caffeine kick - I usually drink 4 shots of espresso in a nice latte first thing in the morning, but with this stuff - I only need two shots and I'm in orbit for the rest of the day...<br /><br />It doesn't give you a crazy caffeine buzz either - just a nice awake feeling...  Worth every penny and I recommend it to my friends all the time.<br /><br />As soon as I run out, I'm buying more...\n",

      "(Because we tried all three, I wanted to post these on each pouch page.)<br /><br />YUM! Our 17 month old daughter loves them. When we heard about these new pouches, they were a _must try_. We couldnt decide on a fruit combination, so we ordered a case of each. This worked out well, because the order qualified for amazons free shipping. They arrived very quickly in easy to open cases.<br /><br />We consolidated them to a box in the pantry so we could get to them faster and because those pouches can kind of slide around. :) Our daughter is all about choices right now and so we let her decide which one she'd like to try first. She looked carefully at each of them then said \"NANA! ARN! BUH-NEE! HOP! HOP!\" and so chose the Mango, Banana and Orange...and it remains her favorite of the three (although, she would never give up the others if offered).<br /><br />Now, the plane ride...we recently took a trip to visit grandma from San Jose to Austin - a 4+ hour airflight that we were somewhat nervous about. We packed our fruit pouches and other goodies. It became a special treat as we rolled out to the tarmac and then took off into the sky. She happily ate and when she was done, sat quietly and contently looking at the pouch...pointing at the bunny and the orange and the banana, (we told/showed her there was a mango too).<br /><br />When we ran out of pouches, we went to the whole foods - but they were not yet available there. They did have another brand, which we reluctantly purchased because unlike the peter rabbit pouches - the cap was so tiny, it could be a serious choking hazzard should it get into the hands (or mouth) of our little lady. The combination was also different and she didnt really care for the other kind as much.<br /><br />Though she cant say alot of words, she does sign quite a few and she runs to the pantry, points and signs \"more, please...more please!! please!!\" Which is pretty funny to see.<br /><br />We took some video the day they arrived, I'll have to see if I can find it and post as part of the review.<br /><br />All the best!\n",

      "Don't waste your dogs time with these skinny minnie ones. My bulldog puppy shreds any one of these in about 10 minutes.<br />I ordered a pack of these only because Amazon discontinued the prime shipping on 12\" Best Bully sticks (by BBS).<br />Absolutely no comparison. These guys dish the sticks out by the pound,not like BestBullySticks by the count, and the sticks by BBS are much thicker and keep my dog happily busy for a long time. Do yourselves a favor and get the good stuff from BBS.\n",

      "If you go to the manufacturer's site for this product, you'll find nothing but five-star reviews.  Very suspicious, because this product DOES NOT WORK, as many other Amazon reviewers have pointed out.  If I could have given this product zero stars, I would have.<br /><br />After an infestation caused by a rolled-up wool rug that came back from the cleaner damp, I set out these traps. They did not trap a single moth--not one.  I went to Meijer's and purchased their traps, Enoz brand, and two of the traps were loaded with moths after two days. And they cost half as much as the Safer brand.<br /><br />Clothes moths are no joke.  They will destroy your carpets, drapes, linens, and clothing, and they breed unbelievably fast.  Don't waste your money on a product that doesn't work.  And keep in mind that traps are only one part of the solution. If the infestation is bad, you will need to spray; you can find sprays that are safe for children and pets at Loew's.  And, perhaps most importantly, vaccuum.  Vaccuum, vaccuum, VACCUUM! Do it daily, and if you have carpet, pay special attention to the area where the carpet hits the baseboard:  Moths love to breed in that area.\n",

      "Being someone who's baked a great deal in my life, as well as finding creative ways to making eating healthy delicious, I guess you could say I am a \"foody\" of sorts, as well as a connoisseur of foods of all types, especially when it comes to flavor. Considering the economy and the fact that it's hit each of us a great deal, I usually do my shopping for spices and extracts at places like Christmas Tree Shops, or Ocean State Job Lot, with the occasional time here on this site when purchasing something else. That said, I did none of those three. Also, I'd like to add, considering the first two options for shopping, I've never ONCE had an issue with flavor, or freshness when it comes to those products. I decided on one recent trip to Walmart, only initially purchasing almond milk, walking towards the register, as I was passing the baker aisle and noticing the Watkins label, to buy a few extracts from this particular brand, as, I figured, it was a decent, reputable brand. How could I go wrong?? And so, ideas of delicious oatmeal recipes and once in a while, adding a flavor that would go well with my chocolate casein, or whey protein, my grubby hands grabbed a few of Watkins flavor, rum being one of them. In fact, rum extract has become somewhat of a staple when I decided to buy it on a whim at Ocean State. I LOVE adding rum flavor to my shakes! This one was such a HUGE disappointment, and not to mention, questioning what is in it, aside from the ingredients listed.<br /><br />Once I got home, I opened each package, and, in doing so, smelled each one, as we all know, every extract from every brand can differ in taste and smell. Once I got to the rum, I cringed a bit. The smell is most familiar. A bit of a plastic-type smell, but oddly, more of a smell of something out of a nail salon or nail tech school. I should know, I used to do  my own nails. The smell was that of acrylic liquid! I gave it the benefit of the doubt, thinking, it probably tastes fine ,but it doesn't. Tastes gross. Like a chemical, or plastic, or, who knows, maybe it is acrylic liquid. I know everyone's taste buds are different and if you're willing to give it a go, by all means, go for it, but as for me, I will NOT be purchasing this particular brand of rum extract again! GROSS! If I could give it zero stars, I would. It's that bad to me.\n",

      "I have loved the Good Earth Original Sweet and Spicy caffeine free tea for as long as I can remember.  For some reason, Safeway and Trader Joes stopped selling it, so I ordered 12 boxes from Amazon.  Before ordering, I noticed they had changed the box design, but also noticed the new box said, \"New Look, Same Great Taste\", so I felt I would get the same great tea I have loved for many years.  Not the case!!!  The tea tastes very different from the Good Earth Sweet and Spicy tea I love.  When I called Good Earth to speak to someone about this, the customer service representative told me there was no change made to the tea, but new packaging.  I told him that couldn't be true and he finally told me that they have added artificial sweeteners and flavors to the Good Earth tea that comes in the new packaging.  He said if I wanted to get the tea I was used to tasting, I would need to buy the 25 count tea box not the 18 count box.  This doesn't make any sense to me at all, but I wanted to let Amazon customers know how to get the tea that they have come to love from Good Earth.  The representative from Good Earth said I could call 1-866-972-6879 to order the true original Good Earth caffeine tea in the 25 count box and it wouldn't have the newly added artificial flavors or sweeteners that they put in the tea that comes in the 18 count box.  Amazon may also sell the 25 count box, I will have to check.  Note: I just realized I selected the wrong product for my review. I purchased the 18 count Good Earth Caffeine Free Sweet and Spicy Tea, not the 25 count box.  If I had purchased the 25 count box, all would have been fine.\n",

      "Eggnog is really a seasonal treat, and most people associate it with Christmas. For me, though, it means fall! Because as soon as it hits the shelves, I buy some. Sadly, though, eggnog is not my friend. It's delicious, but so rich even a small mug can make me a bit nauseous and regretful. Yet I still go back! This matcha is a great way to get that warm, creamy, custardy taste without any of the regretful stares into a fat and sugar filled mug. Because, well, matcha is healthy!<br /><br />This is like eggnog's light, airy and more mature older sister. The grassiness of the matcha cuts through the custard richness, capturing all of the taste but none of that heaviness. The vanilla here is really nice, but my favorite part is the spices--that hint of nutmeg really brings together everything else! This is perfect as a hot latte, though even with just water it's quite delicious and dessert-y.\n",

      "Being someone who actually does NOT like bananas, this was actually quite delicious. Though this product, among a few others, was sent to me for testing purposes compliments of Influentser through their \"Summer Beauty Voxbox\" program, I would say that this would be a nice \"pick me up\" snack on the go. Moreover, though I did eat half of it, I ended up warming up the other half of the soft baked banana nut bread bar in the microwave (as directed) and it tasted good as well! With all that being said, is this my \"Holy Grail\" of snacks (I'm actually not much of a snack person to begin with) and I cannot live without it? No, BUT if I happen to see this in the stores and I wanted to pick up something, I would re-purchase this item due to it being a \"healthier\" option, a nice size (in my opinion) and the taste of it is quite pleasant.\n",

      "I have never cooked tapioca, never in my life.  I have never made a merangue.  But I was tired of paying almost $5 for a small tub of pre-made, store bought tapioca so I thought I would try this because of the reviews from others.<br /><br />I cannot properly explain how this product has changed my life.  Instead of buying the tapioca in the store (the pre-made stuff - tasted okay, or so I thought before I cooked Bob's Red Mill Tapioca from scratch!  At first I wasn't thrilled at having to buy eggs, 2% milk, and vanilla extract in order to make this.  And when I tried to make the meringue that this recipe calls for I messed up the first batch because I tried making it in an old plastic bowl.  So I went online and learned the proper way of making a merangue (since I don't have a metal or glass mixing bowl, I ended up using a 2 quart non-stick pan - it worked great!).  Once I mastered the technique of whipping up the egg whites and making a merangue, I was set!<br /><br />I have made 4 batches of this tapioca so far and just cannot tell you how GREAT it is. So light and fluffy and it is made fresh, out of good, healthy, natural ingredients.  I am absolutely thrilled with this product.  I was so proud of myself learning how to do this that I left a large bowl of it for some friends from church - they love it, too!!!!<br /><br />I ordered this through the \"subscribe and save\" option.  This lowered the price and I get free shipping!  This makes the cost of tapioca almost free compared to the stuff I bought at the store.  Like I said before, I have made 4 batches of this so far and I seems as though the bag is still as full as when I opened it - this stuff is going to last forever!  I like it so much I am going to order a bunch of this to give as Christmas presents and I can't wait to try variations on the basic recipe.<br /><br />If you like tapioca pudding, I HIGHLY recommend buying this product.  After you make a batch or two is becomes really easy, even if you have no experience cooking like this - like me (I actually enjoy whipping the eggs whites by hand to make the merangue - who knew?!).  Get this product and order it through the 'subscribe and save\" option, you can't go wrong!!!\n",

      "I have used all of More Than Gourmet's products, and this staple has to be my favorite, or at least my most used one.  I probably use this on a good 20% of all my main course recipes.<br /><br />There are two main reasons I am a fan.  The first is practical.  I now work overseas, and I need products with a good shelf.  Sure, I can ship via Amazon directly here, but I like to ship to my US address and then bring products with me on the plane.  And all of More Than Gourmet's products have extremely long shelf lives.  With the smaller 1.5 ounce packages, I use one as I need it and keep the rest in my small pantry.  And if I am going to a diner party where I will cook, it is so easy to bring an individual package. (I also buy the larger 16 ounce container as well, and keep it in the fridge after opening.)<br /><br />The second one, and this one is the most important, is that it tastes great.  It does not have that artificial aftertaste which I find in most powered demi-glace.  There is a richness in it which makes everything taste better. I not only use it in typically French-type dishes, but in Italian pasta sauces, all stews, some egg dishes, pot roasts, and even Mexican, Arabic, and Chinese dishes.<br /><br />Working in SE Asia, getting good beef is problematic and quite expensive.  But pork is good.  I have discovered that adding some of the demi-glace to a pork pot roast or to a bourguignon goes along way to make it richer and \"beefier.\"<br /><br />Frankly, I could not do without my More Than Gourmet demi-glace.  It iis a must item in any cook's pantry.\n",

      "I use a large variety of Asian noodles in my cooking.  This is the best one yet !  Was surprised to see them come packed in water.  The pre-boiling, and rinsing is very important.  While they are draining, I prepare the  rest of the ingredients for the meal, usually shitaki mushrooms, chopped green onions, grated carrot,garlic,<br />and Bokchoy or Napa cabbage for stir frying in chicken broth along with the noodles.<br /><br />For additional flavor, I add roasted Sesame seeds and low sodium soy sauce or a little chopped seaweed.  The meal is delicious and very filling.  Most of the time after a nice meal like that, you get a craving for another serving a few hours later.  Not this time.  Felt like I ate a giant meal that stayed with me all day.<br /><br />No cravings.  Day after, still felt full, could only eat a small meal.  Still had lots of energy.  When  you dump the noodles in the pot of boiling water, take a pair of scissors and cut the noodles into shorter lengths.  This will make it easier to serve and eat.  They are a lot longer than most of the other noodles on the market.<br /><br />Since the noodles are so filling for such a small amount, it's very deceptive, I am now adding a package of mung bean noodles to them, to add volume. You can't tell the difference in the taste or looks.  Just subscribed for a monthly order.\n",

      "This ramen noodle soup is much better than plain old Top Ramen or Cup Noodles. In the package is three things: the noodle block, the broth packet, and the vegetable packet. The Udon-style noodles are pressed together in a circle shape. They're thicker than regular ramen, and have a very slight chewiness to them when cooked. The red broth powder is in the foil packet. You can smell the spiciness when you open it. The broth is quite spicy, but only has a hint of a seafood flavor. Most of the \"seafood\" comes from the veggie packet, which contains a bunch of seaweed, green onion flakes, carrot bits, and shiitake mushroom pieces. You could say it's a Spicy Seaweed flavor instead of Spicy Seafood. Overall, it's some of the best ramen I've had.<br /><br />Oh, and Nong Shim gives both stovetop and microwave cooking directions on the package. Nice if you only have a stove or microwave available.\n",

      "We have a 5 year old mixed breed dog who weighs about 85 pounds on good days.  Frankly, she has had a rough time of it.  She caught the very tail end of the dog food crisis, ended up with kidney problems that rear their ugly heads now and then, and has become the world's pickiest dog food eater.  Chances are good that if she will eat any given dog food, it is a 50-50 proposition as to whether or not her kidneys will act up.  As a result, Miss Ted's people have tried any number of dog foods - the cheap stuff, the expensive stuff, the special diet stuff, the stuff from Walmart, the stuff from the grocery store, the stuff from the pet store, the stuff from the vet, even the refrigerated stuff, so I was happy to be given a chance to try <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I\">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a>.<br /><br />The bag arrived beautifully packaged and unlike his normal habit of simply leaving things on the porch, the UPS driver carried this all the way upstairs for  me.  (I  was very grateful.) Miss Ted happened to be in one of her \"that stuff is poison and I'm not going to touch it so I'll just eat the cat's food until I can get into the pantry for some real people food\" mood, so her bowl remained untouched.  We tried another half-dozen times over a period of 10 days or so and got the same reaction every time. The dog food looks fine and smells fine, but Miss Ted won't eat Beneful - even if she hasn't eaten anything but the cat food in a couple of days.<br /><br />Others have pointed out some of the controversy surrounding this particular dog food, as well as the low rating given to the product by the Dog Food Advisor due to the high fat and carbohydrate levels.<br /><br />Grandma's $0.02:  if you are feeding strays like Grandma did out West, then this might be a good option and having the dog food delivered is a fantastic service.  On the other hand, if you have a \"special needs\" dog, the is probably not the best option.<br /><br />Your call.\n",

      "It's simple really, My dog is a very picky eater, not to mention she's allergic to so many things. We tried a lot of the name brand dog foods out there (Iams, Avoderm, Science Diet). Nothing worked, so then one night when she was out of food I went to the store and grabbed two small bags of dog food. Happy Hips was one of them. She immediately wanted to smell the bag right after opening it (which she never did before), and as soon as we put it in her bowl she devoured it. With all of the dog food we had previously given her we always had to mix it with something just to get her to eat it, that wasn't the case with Happy Hips, she ate it dry the first night and is still eating it dry 2 months later. She always got bored with the other dog food, after a couple weeks she would stop eating and/or put her nose up to it. She doesn't do that with Happy Hips. She absolutely loves it. Plus it's all natural and made in the U.S.A. You pay more for it, but it's well worth it. If you have never given this to your dog, it may be best to start them off with 4 pound bag or find somewhere you can get a free sample. But I would strongly recommend this to anyone who has a dog. I have also found that Amazon is so far the cheapest place to buy this dog food, and when I buy it, I get the free shipping as well.\n",

      "WOW, what more can I say but A++++ from ALL my pets.  I tried Raw Boost Bites, a freeze dried treat; the chicken Formula.  I loved the ingredients.  Almost all real items I understand and would eat myself (if I wanted to eat that healthy).  The inside package has a zip top to keep the bites fresh.  Each treat is a round \"disk\" of dried ingredients, a little larger than a cracker and thicker.  There is very little if any smell to them, and they are dry to the touch.  I broke one Boost Bite into 4ths and gave some to each dog to try. The box says 1 Boost Bite per day per 20 pounds of body weight.  I have a 40 pound, a 20 pound, and a 12 pound dog.  Each gobbled it up immediately and looked for more.  I had one piece left and the cat was looking at me I offered it to him and he gobbled it up.  Then I re-inspected the front of the box.  It says it's for dogs AND cats!  I have 3 cats.  One cat will eat anything, but the other two are finicky.  There was no turning down the Boost Bites.  They all loved it.  If you have a finicky cat and are looking for a healthy treat, this has got to be your next purchase.  I was amazed at how much they enjoyed them.  Dog and cat tested.  6 out of 6 give it 4 paws up!\n",

      "Good Day, extremely happy I was able to find a company that produces a particular cheese called Liederkranz. Limited selection of two or three types with various packaging sizes. The only disappointing aspect of this purchase was I expected this purchase to arrive in time for our 500+ mile drive to deliver it my father prior to Thanksgiving. The company who rec'd this order chose not to send this order out till the 29th of November thus missing out on the personal delivery by my family and instead having to be mailed again by Federal Express.<br />I will order again from this company however I will communicate my concerns prior to ordering this time. Thanks again for the cheese. Excellent product.\n",

      "I tried this Amazon Grocery as an experiment because they had a $20 off coupon for $50 in purchases.  I know the kids love the Krispies and got them some. The cereal came in a big box, the contents where okay - though dinged around the edges, and the shipping time was a little slower than I usually get for packages.  There is certainly nothing wrong with the food here - but when I compared the cost to the local grocery store I saw a huge price difference. If you can be patient, certain cereals always seems to go on sale and this is one of them. Just yesterday I saw 3 17.5oz boxes for $6.00.  Wow.<br /><br />Since the idea is to save on costs from volume purchasing, the idea failed.  Without the coupon, this food buy was not a good deal at all. One by one I saw all the products offered and all the ones I bought become sale items that were significantly less expensive - we're talking in the 45% range here.  I suppose, if you are in a remote area where the gas cost would eat the savings of finding a good price, this would be a decent service. But anyone in a suburban or urban setting will get a better deal at the Kroger's or Ralphs than this.\n",

      "okay.  so, the flavor wears off real fast.  be forewarned about that.<br /><br />BUT-----this gum is perfect for my needs.  i had wanted something to clean my teeth/mouth in between meals (like at work after having a snack when i can't brush my teeth)  I don't intend to chew it very long so the fact that the flavor wears off fast doesn't bother me.  I answer phones at work anyway so i can't sit there chomping on gum.....<br /><br />My breath seems fresh & my mouth feels clean, so mission accomplished  :)<br /><br />One other thing i noticed that is AWESOME is that my sinuses are clearing out a lot.  I am always feeling stuffed up & have sinus problems every day. i often feel a lump in my throat when i swallow.  I have allergies & silent reflux at night so the whole area is irritated.  especially after consuming sugar, it gets worse.<br /><br />so anyway i chewed about 6 pieces of this gum today over the past 2 hrs & i feel SO much better.  I knew xylitol has anti-bacterial properties but everything i had read spoke of how good it is for your teeth. that is why i bought it. it didn't occur to me that there were other benefits. So i didn't realize when i bought the gum is that people actually use xylitol as a nasal wash & even to clear up ear infections. i discovered this only after clearly noticing the effects on myself.  it was so drastic that i did more research online (google of course).  I mean the change was so noticable for me that i thought this can't be just a coincidence & went to look it up. and lo & behold it is used to cure sinus & ear infections!  i also bought xylitol granules to use as sweetener in my tea instead of regular sugar.  now i'm going to dissolve it in mater & gargle with it too. and I will continue to use this gum every day as well.\n",

She wants one all the time! Her bowel movements are not affected by them in a negative way. The only thing I would say that is a con is that they don't last very long!

I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat.  Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out.\n",

This granola is not really comparable to your typical \"granola\" but it's a nice snack on it's own. It has a subtle cocoa taste, and a nice crunch!

      "I used to buy the highly spiced and addictive Wasabi peas from an Asian grocery. They went great with beer. But the crunchiness of the dried peas got to me and my husband after a while, so we stopped getting them. When I run across Blue Diamond Bold Wasabi & Soy Sauce Almonds, I was ecstatic. Now I could once again enjoy the taste of Wasabi as well as enjoy the health benefits of almonds at the same time.<br /><br />You can tell that these almonds are flavored as they have a powdery coating. I was a little bit worried as I remembered that some of the wasabi peas were very hot. In case you're not familiar with wasabi, it is the green paste that is typically served with sushi and diluted down with soy sauce. It is also known as Japanese horseradish, and is quite hot. Fortunately, Blue Diamond has tempered the wasabi with  the savory taste of  soy sauce and it's not as hot as it is in Japanese snack food. But make no mistake, it still has a nice kick, but it doesn't have a long lasting effect. The initial punch of heat fades out quickly to make way for the salty, slightly smoky flavor of soy sauce, making it a very enjoyable snack.<br /><br />5 star snack!\n",

      "I really love these crispy thins.  They remind me of really good dark chocolate bars with chili and cinnamon in them.  Yes, I even added some chili to get a true Mayan taste out of these.  I did however think that there weren't six servings in a bag.  I did measure it out and an ounce is about 39-40 thins not 46 like the packaging claims.  Which makes five servings, not six.  I measured this a few times with my scale and got 39-40 thins in an ounce.  I think one of the addictive properties of this blend is the cane sugar and it has a lot of it, so I tend to only have an ounce at a time, if I can drag myself away.  I could easily eat six ounces of this product without thinking...just eat without the think but I would be smiling! :)  It has a good sweet cinnamon taste, if they added a little chili or had a chili cinnamon flavor, it would probably be one of the best treats ever.  This also works as cereal or blended with oatmeal, I've tried eating them a lot of ways.  They do remind me of a luxury level Count Chocula, the cocoa used is very flavorful and the addition of rice and sesame seeds works with the cane sugar and cocoa.  I am not sure if this is health food, but I don't really care.  I love it anyway.  :)\n",

      "I am not a foodie, but I do like to eat.  Some would say that I love to eat.<br /><br />The basics: Each packet contains regular microwave popcorn and an envelope of cheese powder to be sprinkled over the popcorn.<br /><br />Flavor:  The cheese flavor doesn't taste like any cheese that I'd like to eat, if it tastes like cheese at all.  I can't quite place the flavor, but white cheddar?  Not at all.  If real cheese tasted anywhere near this bad, I wouldn't need to go to the gym.  Even people that eat blue cheese would stay away from this stuff.<br />I bought a single package from my grocer thinking: Hey it is only $1.19.  What could I lose?  Well I lost $1.19 plus tax!<br />Flavor is a complete bust.<br /><br />Popcorn:  Nice and fluffy.  If I hadn't sprinkled the mystery powder over all of the popcorn, I would have enjoyed snacking on the plain popped corn. But nooo, in my enthusiasm to finally free myself from the grips of my local gourmet popcorn dealer, I sprinkled the pack of powder on all of the popcorn.  But I digress...  I counted 31 total un-popped or partially popped kernels.  The popcorn would have been awesome if not for the `cheese powder'.  (Of course, your results may vary according to your microwave oven and superior button pushing abilities.)<br /><br />No stars for flavor<br />Five stars for popcorn.<br />Overall: One star.

I mix it with Almond milk(I love cow's milk, but it doesn't love me :(  ) I sweeten the mix with a dusting of stevia sweetener. You don't need very much stevia as it is very sweet.
